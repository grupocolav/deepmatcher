    "# Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data processing for labeled datasets involves the following operations:**\n",
    "1. Read and preprocess train, validation and test CSV files (involves data alterations, e.g., tokenization).\n",
    "2. Compute global vocabulary (set of all unique words in all 3 datasets).\n",
    "3. Compute word embeddings for all words in vocabulary.\n",
    "4. Compute metadata on training set (e.g., word frequencies).\n",
    "5. Save all 3 processed datasets to cache along with data processing info.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data processing for unlabeled datasets involves the following operations:**\n",
    "1. Read and preprocess unlabeled CSV file (involves data alterations, e.g., tokenization).\n",
    "2. Compute vocabulary (set of all unique words in all unlabeled dataset).\n",
    "3. Compute word embeddings for words in vocabulary that are not present in labeled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `deepmatcher` we aim to simplify and abstract away the complexity of data processing as much as possible. In some cases however, you may need to customize some aspects of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured into four sections, each describing one kind of customization:\n",
    "1. CSV format\n",
    "2. Data alterations\n",
    "3. Word embeddings\n",
    "4. Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. CSV format\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the getting started tutorial, each CSV file is assumed to have the following kinds of columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"Left\" attributes (required):** Remember our goal is to match tuple pairs across two tables (e.g., table A and B). \"Left\" attributes are columns that correspond to the \"left\" tuple or the first tuple (in table A) in an tuple pair. These column names are expected to be prefixed with \"left_\" by default. This can be customized by setting the `left_prefix` parameter (e.g., use \"ltable_\" as the prefix).\n",
    "* **\"Right\" attributes (required):** \"Right\" attributes are columns that correspond to the \"right\" tuple or the second tuple (in table B) in an tuple pair. These column names are expected to be prefixed with \"right_\" by default. This can be customized by setting the `right_prefix` parameter (e.g., use \"rtable_\" as the prefix).\n",
    "* **Label column (required for train, validation, test):** Column containing the labels (match or non-match) for each tuple pair. Expected to be named \"label\" by default. This can be customized by setting the `label_attr` parameter.\n",
    "* **ID column (required):** Column containing a unique ID for each tuple pair. This is for evaluation convenience.  Expected to be named \"id\" by default. This can be customized by setting the `id_attr` parameter.\n",

The tokenizer can be set by specifying the `tokenizer` parameter. By default, this is set to `\"nltk\"`, which will use the **[default nltk tokenizer](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize)**. Alternatively, you may set this to `\"spacy\"` which will use the tokenizer provided by the `spacy` package. You need to first [install and setup](https://spacy.io/usage/) `spacy` to do this."

    "Processing data is time consuming. In order to reduce the time spent in processing, `deepmatcher` automatically caches the result of the data processing step for all labeled datasets. It is designed such that users do not need to be aware of its existence at all - you only need to call `deepmatcher.data.process` as you would normally. In the first such call, `deepmatcher` would do the processing and cache the result. In subsequent calls, unless there are any changes to this call that would necessitate re-processing data, e.g., a modification in any of the data files or a change in the tokenizer used, `deepmatcher` will re-use the cached results. If there changes that makes the cache invalid, it will automatically rebuild the cache. The caching behavior can be customized by setting these parameters in the `deepmatcher.data.process` call:\n",
